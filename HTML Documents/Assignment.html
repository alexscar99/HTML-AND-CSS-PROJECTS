			<h3>In the US, the Great Pyrenees are an amazing yet uncommon dog breed</h3>
			<h6>They are known to be "gentle giants" for being calm, despite their large stature</h6>

			<p>Quick description of them from Wikipedia:</p>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenean_Mountain_Dog">
				The Pyrenean Mountain Dog or Chien de Montagne des Pyrénées is a French breed of livestock guardian dog; in France it is commonly called the Patou. It originates from the eastern or French side of the Pyrenees Mountains that separate France and Spain and is recognised as a separate breed from the Pyrenean Mastiff from the Spanish side of the mountains, to which it is closely related.

The Patou is widely used throughout France as a livestock guardian, particularly in the French Alps and the Pyrenees, protecting flocks from predation by wolves and bears. It is known as the Great Pyrenees in the United States, where it is also used to protect flocks from various predators.
